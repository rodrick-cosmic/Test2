<h3>Internet, Society and Design Justice and good ol' ethical design</h3>

<p class="yellow-div">
    Former American president, Barack Obama said, “The Internet is not a luxury, it is a necessity.” During an announcement of ConnectHome, a program launched in July 2015 to offer free Internet service to 275,000 low-income households in twenty-seven cities and one tribal nation.
    <br> </br>
    I want to take a bit of a different approach to this critical writing, I think ethical design and inclusion in the digital space is a very diverse and quite frankly, controversial topic. I want to focus on three particular aspects: ethical design, ‘digital exclusion’ and a possible way to mitigate or even solve these.
    <br> </br>
    Before we consider what these concepts are, it is important to understand that they are all closely related to one another, in the sense that a lack of ethical design leads digital exclusion and digital exclusion results in less progressive ideals from minorities affected by digital exclusion.
    <br> </br>
    A variety of societal and personal variables contribute to our understanding of what we term digital exclusion. Which is best described as a situation wherein a segment of the population continues to suffer due to uneven access to and capacity to utilize information and communication technologies (ICT) that are required to fully participate in society (Schejter, 2015; Warren, 2007). This sentiment is essentially relevant in modern society as arguably almost every aspect of society has a heavy emphasis on technological know-how. It is easier to consider how much of society has no technological aspects, it could probably be counted on one hand.
    <br> </br>
    Which brings us to digital exclusion and a still poorly understood link between digital and social exclusion. In their essay, Understanding the Links between Social and Digital Exclusion in Europe Ellen Helsper and Ábel Galácz seek to map out the link between digital and social exclusion, revealing that there are a variety of perspectives on how the two domains interact. For example, by providing underprivileged groups with access to the advantages of internet use, digital involvement can assist to reduce social isolation. However, as long as social disparities exist in real life they will transfer into online inequalities. The reason for this is fairly simple, people who are socially excluded are less likely to have internet access and lack digital skills needed to excel in work, social and perhaps even certain cultural situations.  These vulnerable groups who use the hardly use the Internet or don’t use it at all, are known as the ‘digital underclass’ (*ref). Despite improvements in infrastructure policies and increased access, digital inclusion is unlikely to reach all groups, and may potentially provide a new obstacle to social mobility. The majority of research exploring the causes for internet non-use has been based on single-country cohort studies. The reasons for being offline have drastically changed from say 2005, 2013 and 2022. An interesting observation is that non-user populations have been more concentrated among disadvantaged groups, according to Swedish and British data (Helsper and Reisdorf, 2016). 
    <br> </br>
    
    
    <br> </br>
    While conventional explanations for the digital divide such as a lack of access and skills remain essential, motivating factors have become increasingly crucial over time. The prominence of these causes varies, as do the justifications for digital exclusion in other countries. 
    <br> </br>
    People who are socially isolated have less access to and usage of the internet, gadgets, and online services. Economically disadvantaged people have restricted access as well, but they are more inclined to seek it out in locations like libraries. Those who fall into both groups are at a severe disadvantage and are of little or no service (Helsper, 2008). Non-users are getting older, less educated, more likely to be jobless, handicapped, and socially alienated, according to studies (Helsper, 2016). It's important to remember that no two groups are alike, and there might be variances within communities. It's also critical to consider changing trends throughout time. People who were previously digitally disengaged are not the same as those who are now, therefore ways to addressing it must be flexible (Helsper, 2016).
    <br> </br>
    The globe embraced digital change at a breakneck speed in 2020, reinventing technology's crucial role in how we work, study, and live. At the same time, the COVID-19 epidemic brought to light a long-standing issue: billions of people still lack access to the internet. In the same year, Tendayi Achiume, UN Special Rapporteur on racism,  presented a report, in it she spoke of emerging digital technologies and racial discrimination to the UN Human Rights Council. 
    <br> </br>
    "Technology is neither impartial nor objective…It is fundamentally shaped by the racial, ethnic, gender and other inequalities prevalent in society, and typically makes these inequalities worse. It is resulting in discrimination and unequal treatment in all areas of life, from education and employment to healthcare and criminal justice.” 
    <br> </br>
    The issue isn't only extreme racism, xenophobia, and intolerance, according to Achiume. “It goes deeper than that. Corporations such as Facebook have economic and business models that mean they actively profit from misinformation, discrimination, and intolerance.”
    <br> </br>
    She claims that several governments have implemented algorithms that "structurally discriminate against marginalized people." Which brings us to our next point of observation, ethical design. 
    <br> </br>
    Ethical design is something that by all accounts seems fairly inherent to any artefact be it digital or otherwise. It is something that is almost a given, or rather it should be. Instead it is not. Although in theory many understand and even know what ethical design is, too many don’t know the weight this carries and what it entails.
    <br> </br>
    Designing with fair and just ideals, beliefs, and principles is what we can best describe as ethical design. It's important to remember that what you produce has an impact on actual people, and those impacts can and will cause ripples.
    <br> </br>
    Ideally part of being a designer is accepting responsibility for your ethical activities, although this is frequently delegated to others. Over the years what can be considered "ethical" and what has been "normalized"  has altered as a result of culture, society, and politics. Navigating such an everchanging aspect of design and more importantly-tech seems no better than walking in a minefield, while blindfolded and with your arms tied behind your back. 
    <br> </br>
    However, it isn’t all doom and gloom. And believe it or not there is and are solutions available. 
    <br> </br>
    Many factors contribute to ethical design being neglected or ignored. Some may argue that it is inconvenient, too complicated, or that time and money are in short supply. These issues may be alleviated by beginning with the correct expectations and goals from the beginning. Change isn't something that happens overnight. You may achieve long-term organizational transformation by taking incremental measures at every opportunity.
    <br> </br>
    The other issue is defining who is responsible for ensuring that the design is ethical. Whose responsibility is it: the boss's, the client's, the manufacturer's, the government, or the consumer?
    <br> </br>
    Designers, like everyone else, take a bite out of the accountability pie. You may take the time to investigate if items are developed ethically, and if they aren't, hold everyone accountable.
    Keep these ethical design concepts in mind as you move forward with your future initiatives out of a sense of duty to the environment, humanity, and yourself. You may even make a promise to include this in your designer code of ethics. Holding on to convictions and moral principles will guide you to the greatest potential conclusion, regardless of how you practice ethical design. 
    <br> </br>
    My opinion on this and what I’ve learnt while researching is that there is a massive gap in terms of the digital space, however the good news is that the divide is narrowing and the space is getting more and more tolerant and more importantly more inclusive. There is and perhaps will always be more room to improve and make the spaces more inclusive for minorities.
