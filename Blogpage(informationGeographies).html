            “We live not just in the physical world but also in the digital world. Fighting apartheid in the physical world is much easier than fighting it in the digital world. The reality is that we are still in a warped digital world that creates a false pretext of neutrality.” </br>

            -Vice-Chancellor and Principal of the University of Johannesburg Prof. Tshilidzi Marwala </br>
            
           <br> The following essay will be an in-depth discussion of the reading, “Towards a study of information geographies”. It will summarize key points, critically reflect on the subject matter and offer a step by step breakdown of the reading, wherein the aims, methodology and results are highlighted. </br>
            
            <br> Chapter 1. Introduction: information geographies and
            (im)mutable augmentations </br>
        
            <br> The text begins with the idea that information has ‘geography’, that is to say it always originates from some point be it spatially or temporally. Information comes from somewhere and this information also exists physically “mediated by networks, infrastructures, and technologies” . Despite how illusory the notion of the web is, it is still built fundamentally on basic technological principles and practices something that many overlook when consider cloud based technologies.
            
            Graham et el, move to what they term “immutable augmentations”, the basis of the text. However, the term seems somewhat paradoxical, how can something rigid and fixed also be enhanced and upgraded?
            
            The notion of immutable information is based on the fact that the circulation of information between different locations, allows for the core of the information to remain unchanged (immutable). Information is thus arranged in an active process across various geographical contexts. The information changes and is shaped as a result of its location (augmentation), and the geography from whence the information originated can influence it. To place this into context, this is essentially the same school of thought as a person being a product of the environment they are from.
            
            Immutable augmentations, according to Graham et al, are simply something that does not alter.</br>

            
           <br> <p> "ICTs have also facilitated an evolution of information beyond immutable mobiles through the creation of ‘(im)mutable augmentations’ characterized by the layering of dynamic information across and over geographic space. Thus, not only does information have particular geographies, but geography itself is layered, defined, and augmented by information that is more or less immutable" (Graham, M., De Sabbata, S., Zook, M. A., 2015)
            
            The text uses the example of The Sydney Opera House. </p>
            
            <p>Here it claims that it is “not just a building made from bricks and mortar”. Yet it is neither reduced to “guidebook entries, postcards and other immutable mobiles” Instead The Sydney Opera House is images, videos, online reviews and even past performances. All of which are stored and easily   accessible through online maps, annotations and websites.</p>
            
            Graham et el goes on to bring up quite an interesting point, “Places invisible or discounted in representations are invisible in practice to many people.” The same principle can be applied to when we start to think about how marginalised people are oppressed and discriminated against, not were, because it is happening even now as we speak. Due to the fact that we do not see it is rendered ‘invisible’ however it is still there, still happening, still a reality. However due to the rapid information age we live in, it has become so normalized to believe things on face value and validate places, people and experiences based on the ability to see their online representations.</br>
            
           <br> Chapter 2: Pre-Digital Pieces of Information</br>
            
           <br> Prior to the advent of the ‘digital age’, information was scarce and relied heavily upon geographical specificities. Tools for the creation and distribution of information were held by small groups of people, “were concentrated in only a few hands and places; making the ability to engage in large-scale data collection relatively rare.” (Graham, M., De Sabbata, S., Zook, M. A., 2015)
            
            If we were to look at feudal Europe, most of the general population were illiterate and generally speaking it was mainly the church and a few nobles that could read. Information was controlled and circulated by a group of ‘elites’, as such most people had extremely limited access to books. Additionally access to information was also dictated by the formats appropriate for those that understood the information’s “codified content.”
            
            Another key gridlock in the processing of information revolved around the availability of “requisite skillsets” To combat this institutions such as “universities, associations, and guilds “emerged to meet this
            challenge, many of which were spatially fixed and still ushered in a sense of exclusion due concentrated nature of these institutions.</br>
            
            <br> Due to these arguably deliberate strategies of exclusion, “hegemonic representations” and “hegemonic modes of participation” are at the centre of this. More importantly these hegemonic practices are deeply rooted in a means of control and exerting social, economic and even political power.
            “‘most of Africa is being left in a technological apartheid’ ” (Graham, M., De Sabbata, S., Zook, M. A., 2015) Due to these hegemonic power relations around the world and the (im)balance of power, historically is has been far more common and easier for information to be created and accessed with the ‘global North’ in mind, while the ‘global South’ is essentially separated and neglected, further excluded and creating a deeper sense of inequality. This can best be seen in the concept of the digital divide.</br>
            
           <br> Chapter 3: Changing Geographies after the Information Revolution? </br>
            <br> The past few decades have seen a much needed change in the availability of information. This change has been created through the increased global access to computers and an internet connection. This has allowed for users to view, create, share and organize information on a large scale. In layman’s terms this has meant that the previous bottlenecks that existed in the pre-digital era of information have almost all been negated. However, it is worth noting that this is not a definite shared across all citizens around the world, ‘all the world’s citizens will have the potential to access unlimited knowledge, to express themselves freely, and to contribute to and enjoy the benefits of the knowledge society’ (Touré, 2012).
            
            The use of the word “potential” reminds us that this is not a definite but rather a possibility.
            
            As much as we live in an era where the idea of being connected and sharing information is almost 2nd nature, there still exist various boundaries or ‘invisible geographies’, that limit people because of their geographical context.
        </br>
            <br> Chapter 4: Geographies of Access and Enablement</br>
            <br> “it is key to illustrate global patterns of (dis)connectivity” (Graham, M., De Sabbata, S., Zook, M. A., 2015)
            
            Graham et el claim that understanding the “geographies of access” are key in providing insight into the “distribution of technologies and services that are essential for digital communication, participation, and representation.” Which essentially translates to in order to understand various technologies, one would need to first understand the geographical context surrounding where the technologies emerge from.
            
            The text provides a fairly interesting diagram (from the World Bank) illustrating internet users by country. The first thing one will notice is that the data indicates the ‘global North’ has substantially more internet users than the ‘global South’, which harks back to the idea of the digital divide but more disturbingly the cause of this disconnect. The diagram illustrates a lack of access to digital information for most of the world’s population and according to the text this is as a result of a lack of digital accessibility,  which is brought on by broadband affordability.
            
            “…one of the core themes of the global digital divide: the relative cost of being connected to the internet. Europe and North America have high absolute costs, ranging between about US$10 and 40 a month, but have some of the lowest relative costs in the world: a couple of hours of work a month is sufficient for an average worker to afford the cost of connectivity”
            
            (Graham, M., De Sabbata, S., Zook, M. A., 2015)
            
            Data also showed an interesting but unsurprising trend, China ranked first in having the world’s largest internet population (over half a billion) with the United States, India and Japan following closely behind. Another trend we can observe is how little internet presence many sub-Saharan countries have. The reason is arguably a very simple one, despite broadband becoming increasingly more cheaper, it has not become any less accessible and that is where the disconnect may lie. For instance, in certain countries broadband connections cost “100% of the salary of an average worker in the country” (Graham, M., De Sabbata, S., Zook, M. A., 2015). This sentiment indicates a possible reason as to why internet users are so miniscule in the southern hemisphere. </br>
            
           <br> Chapter 5: Geographies of Participation </br>
            
            <br> In order to understand and even build upon the “Geographies of Participation” one needs to be familiar with the three variables associated with the geographies of participation. Of these, there are domain names, GitHub contributions and lastly Wikipedia edits.
            
            Domain names “are useful providing a proxy for the location of digital content” (Graham, M., De Sabbata, S., Zook, M. A., 2015). Domain names are essentially the ‘building block[s]’ of the internet along with where they are geographically from. Graham et al found that the distribution of domain names by country, was dominated by the United States followed by Europe with having the highest percentage of domain names linked to their countries. This trend is indicative of the hegemonic narrative that the ‘global North’ has a large, unequal share of internet participation in terms of domain names.
            
             
            
           <p></p>The text claims that this could be due to the regulations surrounding domain names in various countries, especially where certain countries expect their citizens to adhere to  stricter guidelines around registering domain names, which could prevent many internet users from accessing them. Think about how strictly gatekept internet connectivity is in North Korea.
            
           <p> “A key take-away from this geography of content production is that large internet populations do not
            automatically translate into large numbers of domain registrations….there appears to be large differences between access to information and participating in its creation and distribution with Western Europe and North America far more likely to be home to producers of digital content than anywhere else in the world.”  (Graham, M., De Sabbata, S., Zook, M. A., 2015)</p>
            
           <p> The second variable is GitHub contributions or “distributions of collaborative coding”, which is essentially one of the largest platforms for internet users to publicly publish and collaborate on software development. As can be observed using the data in figure 4, countries in the ‘global North’, namely the United States and Central Europe, have a much greater level of GitHub commits in comparison to the ‘global South’. Which harks back to the sentiment of “concentrated in only a few hands and places; making the ability to engage in large-scale data collection relatively rare.” And once again highlights the disparity between the ‘global North’ and ‘global South’  and more importantly it also fixes a certain identity to the respective spheres.
            </p> One where despite having the means of access users might feel discouraged solely because of how this North/South hegemony permeates every aspect of the space. “With Africa and the Middle East containing considerably fewer people accessing or contributing software than would be expected given the level of internet access.” (Graham, M., De Sabbata, S., Zook, M. A., 2015)
            
            Essentially, despite countries that have few to almost no internet access  and low internet populations, they still do not engage in the digital space on the same level that countries with high internet populations do.
            
            Thirdly is the geography of Wikipedia contributions.
            
            Wikipedia is a free online encyclopaedia, created and edited by volunteers around the world and hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, it is the largest encyclopaedia and as mentioned earlier, allows all internet users to participate in information contributions and edits.  “edits to Wikipedia have
            tremendous power to shape content accessed by the majority of internet users around the world” and this definitely rings true as Wikipedia is largely unmoderated, and as of currently there are little to no means of mitigating fake news or factually incorrect articles from being published. Additionally it is also a goldmine for accessing information that may have otherwise been inaccessible at libraries or academic institutions. The only drawback is that most if not all articles should be taken with a pinch of salt. The Wikipedia contributions data illustrates that Africa as a continent has very few entries, which is in stark contrast to Hong Kong, which has more Wikipedia edits than the entirety of Africa.
        </br>
        
           <br> Chapter 6: Geographies of Representation</br>
            
           <br> The second final part of the text is, “Geographies of representation”, which aims to “better understand the contours of representation within the (im)mutable augmentations” (Graham, M., De Sabbata, S., Zook, M. A., 2015) Which can best be described as highlighting which parts of the world are represented or underrepresented in the digital world.  The text utilizes a number of data capturing softwares to do this namely, Google searches, OpenStreetMap and the Semantic Web.
            
            Data from Google searches was utilized to determine which countries produced the most results. The data that was analysed only worked to confirm the inequities that had previously been discovered and documented earlier in the text with regards to the disparities of accessibility around the world. “Google is the world’s most used search engine and thus the geographic content that it either contains or omits can have significant impacts on the representation of places”. I think it’s also worth mentioning that Google can also play a massive part in the representation of people too.
            
            Because of its open-source nature, OpenStreetMap is the world's largest map of roads. Seeing which areas and places have the most detailed road data reveals which areas are geographically well-represented and which countries are underrepresented. The results revealed that the global North had a substantially higher geographical presence.
            
            The semantic web refers to efforts to make the internet more accessible by providing data that may be utilized across several services. The services of Freebase and Geonames are the topic of this essay. GeoBase is the largest directory of place names, while Freebase is a general knowledge database with millions of entries. Taking the data from these two services and re-mapping it reveals the disparity that was revealed in the earlier investigations. In terms of digital information and representation, the ‘global North’ has far greater representation than the ‘global South’. </br>
            
          <br>  Chapter 7: Towards a Study of Information Geographies </br>
            
          <br>  The assumption that the internet makes information accessible to everyone is untrue, according to the paper's assessment of digital access geography. Large swaths of the globe have little or no interest in digital information access, input, or representation. To close these information geography gaps, several aspects of our society must be addressed, including policymaking, postcolonial information governance, and the infrastructures that currently impede digital access to significant segments of the global population.
            
            This study wants to inspire deeper research into the statistics presented and discussed so that the global community can have a better understanding of the problem and identify methods to make digital information geography really accessible to all. </br>
            
            <br>
            <p>Aims</p>

            <p>The goal of the essay was to perform ground-breaking study into the geographies of digital information in order to better comprehend the fact that there are significant sections of our planet where the internet is not open and available to all. Because there hasn't been much research done on this topic before, this article also intends to open up a new area of study in order to obtain a better knowledge of the issues raised in the paper.
            
            Another goal was to graphically portray the disparity in digital information access. It's difficult to relate plain numbers to the world, but visualizing the data as maps demonstrates the tremendous scope of information discrepancies, and is instrumental in highlighting discrepancies.</p>
            
            <p>Methodology</p>

          <p>
            The data collection process used in the article comprised gathering information from a variety of sources and structuring it so that it could be displayed geographically or in a fashion that showed relative size.
            
            The methodology was effective because it graphically highlighted global differences in digital information access. However, the article acknowledges that the data set was insufficient and that it could not show finer subtleties in global digital access using only generic datasets. More data at the local level should be collected in future studies to better understand the smaller aspects that influenced global access to digital information. I believe that this methodology is beneficial because it effectively highlighted worldwide inequalities in digital information access in a digital and visual manner that was not too taxing on the mind. This is effective because the use of images stimulates the senses more than reading long words and numbers. However, according to the paper, this data isn't as comprehensive as it should be because it relies heavily on generalized data. Therefore, because this is a sector with little research, it is only expected of them to use generalized data; however, more data on a worldwide and local scale should be obtained to make their conclusions more reliable.
        </p>
            
            <p>Results and Conclusions</p>
            
        <p>The analysis indicated that there is a large global disparity in digital information availability, according to the conclusions of the article. The global South, which has a history of inequity, lacks the same level of access to digital information, participation, or representation as the global North.
            
            These findings were predicted, yet they represent a substantial step toward more equal global information sharing. More work may be done to decrease and resolve the causes of these injustices the more the issue is examined, displayed, and understood.</p>
            
           <p> Review of Additional Literature</p>
           <p>For this particular section I did struggle in terms of finding a suitable piece of literature to relate it to. I did however find a particular interest in an article that speaks on the advent of a new , pervasive apartheid, only this time it is situated in our algorithms and digital spaces. This is by no means a new phenomena but our society rapidly becoming digitally-orientated definitely plays a part in bias technologies reinforcing the hegemonic narrative of digitally mediated racism and oppression.
        </p>  The article titled, The rise of machines and digital apartheid: Discrimination by algorithms a social weapon of destruction, written by Prof Tshilidzi Marwala. I chose this particular article as I find it’s subject matter of Discrimination by algorithms particularly poignant and relevant not just for the Information Geographies text but for modern society as well. One of the more prominent ideas in the article can be found in this quote, “Because of its[technology] global nature, it is giving the idea of apartheid a global identity. Discrimination by algorithms knows no geographical boundaries.” (Marwala. T, 2021). There is also an interesting idea that is presented with the article wherein it talks about the importance of education. Which is fundamental in making any space be it physical or digital more inclusive and allowing for people to learn skills that aid in the shifting requirements of society and industries in order to deal with the increase in inequality and job losses resulting from technological advances. Education is also instrumental in identify social injustices and creating ethical frameworks for technologies.
            
            Avenues for Future Research
            There is a very open landscape for change in terms of information geographies, and as a result there is equally as much room to interrogate why these issues are still persisting in the 21st century. I think one of the most crucial avenues for research would be trying to get a fundamental understanding of how the digital divide is very deeply rooted in racism, and colonial thinking. A rather informative essay by S. Derek Turner titled, Digital Denied, aims to address this in relation to the “Impact of Systemic Racial Discrimination on Home-Internet Adoption” (Turner, 2016) and some of the findings were incredibly disturbing to say the least, one such would have to be, that income gaps alone are not responsible for a lack of broadband access in areas where it is available.
