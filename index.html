        I am a 22-year-old, third year student studying Digital Arts at the University Of Witwatersrand. 
        I aspire to one day become a professional game designer and I have a passion for all things digital media, music and film.
        I spend most of my day, experimenting with software mainly Krita, Blender, Photoshop and of course HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
        I enjoy coding and the challenge of learning something new everyday.
        And even more so, I enjoy creating art in whatever capacity.

         Part of why I chose this degree and by extension, this course, is I believe that digital art is the final frontier in creative endeavours.
         Especially in contemporary society. I want to make the space a much more inclusive one where creatives of all shapes, colors,creeds and beliefs can have an equal chance 
         at succeeding. Additionally, I want to make the world a much more tolerable place and I think art is one way to do that because it is able to transcend
         almost any human imposed boundary.

            By the time this is read, I am hopeful my new redesigned website will include all the aspects I wanted and then some. Additionally I am hopeful it will be a lot
            more sleek and demonstrate all I have learnt this semester both in class and independently. Here's hoping that it all sticks together and this is actually read on a 
            functional website.

          Unfortunately, despite all my best efforts my assignment 2 was still not up to my liking but as a consequence of my procrastination I had to submit, and even that process was not a walk in the park
          However, all was not for nought as I learned a valuable lesson, submit early to avoid heartbreak.

            Assignment 2 was a much more challenging expereince, from my website falling apart several times, to the intial JavaScript projects I had not having the functionality that I needed, it was a real PITA, however I actually enjoyed 
            learning and practicing JavaScript because of how vast it was, the possibilities were practically endless, and I wanted to reflect that with my "built with JavaScript" section.

           After the first assignment's submission, I took a bit of a break from programming (which is probably the dumbest thing you can do if you're just starting out)
           I did not do much in the way of actual programming, at least like how I was doing it for assignment 1's submission. That was until assignment 2 was announced, and so the cycle 
           starts once again, and I needed to go back to the drawing board.

            During this time I was still looking at websites thinking that one of them might jump out of the screen and do the work for me.
            I was running out of time, and as it stood I did not even have that much time to start off with. 
            So I decided to procrastinate a bit further, trying to get a feel of what exactly I wanted with my website, eventually I found a tutorial
            on how to do a tie, which is not important, what is important is the video that played after that, "How To Create Engaging Portfolio Webiste using HTML,CSS and JavaScript"

          <h4>April 2022</h4>
          <p>
            This is when I began to do a lot more research regarding portfolio websites, and compling a "moodboard" of how I wanted mine to look like.
            It was also at or around the time I started to do a few online html excercises as practice. Needless to say they went...well.
